# Lab 0
The overall goal of this exercise is to generate a "math.c" and "math.h" file that can eventually be placed into 
an example UART Calculator code.
## Usage
The math.h and math.c files can be placed into a working directory and the function, math(int num1, int num2, char operator),
can be called upon to perform various functions to the integers, num1 and num2 based.
##Functions
Add ("+")
-the sum of num1 and num2 is calculated and the value is returned.
